# A tool for MS Dynamics CRM developer
# Functionalities:
- Display CRM Informations like User info, security roles
- Display CRM Form attributes info
- Lock/unlock or show/hide attributes

> Base on your needs, you can add this tool for All Entities or some specific entities. You can also set up a rule for displaying the tool (e.g. only users with a specific security role can use this tool). That's why I didn't configure this tool in the CRM solution. Instead, I wrote a document for configuration. Please check [Configuration.PDF][cfg] file for more details.
